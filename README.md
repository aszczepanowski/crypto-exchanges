# Test task for stakefish company

Using the Coingecko public API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), build an application that will serve as a directory of cryptocurrency exchanges. The main page should be a list with the first ten exchanges with some high-level information (name, country, URL, logo, trust rank).

When the user clicks on an exchange, show its details on a separate page. Included in those details should be the name, country, trust rank, logo, year of establishment, social media links, description, and a back-to-main-page button.
